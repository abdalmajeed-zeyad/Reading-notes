Django
Software
Django is a Python-based free and open-source web framework that follows the model–template–views architectural pattern. It is maintained by the Django Software Foundation, an American independent organization established as a 501 non-profit.



So where does this Django behind the scenes tour leave us? Django’s code is open source and available to all. Django’s organization is managed by a non-profit, the DSF, with a miniscule budget. And Django code is lead by a core team of volunteers, two paid Django Fellows, and a larger group of contributors.

One of the best ways to become more involved in Django is to attend an annual conference and meet all the contributors in person. Currently there are DjangoCons in the US, Europe, Australia, and Africa in 2020 for the first time. I hope to see some of you there!
