#here what I have learned: 

A command line, or terminal, is a text-based interface to the system, The command line typically presents you with a prompt. As you type, it will be displayed after the prompt. 

 

In systems such as Windows, the extension is important and the system uses it to determine what type of file it is.

 

Under Linux, the system actually ignores the extension and looks inside the file to determine what type of file it is. So for instance I could have a file myself.png which is a picture of me.



A text editor is a piece of software  that
allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write
to build a website. 

 

Visual Studio Code is a free text editor made by the folks at Microsoft.
 VS Code has the Emmet shorthand for HTML and CSS
already built-in with no additional work from you at all.
