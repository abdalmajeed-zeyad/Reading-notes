React - Conditional Rendering

Conditional rendering is a term to describe the ability to render different user interface (UI) markup if a condition is true or false. In React, it allows us to render different elements or components based on a condition. This concept is applied often in the following scenarios: Rendering external data from an API.

React - Lists & Keys:

A “key” is a special string attribute you need to include when creating lists of elements in React. Keys are used to React to identify which items in the list are changed, updated, or deleted. In other words, we can say that keys are used to give an identity to the elements in the lists.


React - Forms

Handling forms is about how you handle the data when it changes value or gets submitted. In HTML, form data is usually handled by the DOM. In React, form data is usually handled by the components. When the data is handled by the components, all the data is stored in the component state .

React - Lifting State

in React, sharing state is accomplished by moving it up to the closest common ancestor of the components that need it. This is called “lifting state up”. We will remove the local state from the TemperatureInput and move it into the Calculator instead.
