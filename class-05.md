This provides a text description
of the image which describes the
image if you cannot see it.

Where an image is placed
in the code will affect how it
is displayed. Here are three
examples of image placement
that produce different results:
1: before a paragraph
The paragraph starts on a new
line after the image.
2: inside the start of a
paragraph
The first row of text aligns with
the bottom of the image.
3: in the middle of a
paragraph
The image is placed between the
words of the paragraph that it
appears in.

align (to left or right)
(top, middle ,botton)
The align attribute was
commonly used to indicate how
the other parts of a page should
flow around an image.

Use GIF or PNG format
when saving images
with few colors or large
areas of the same color.

Images created for the web should be saved at
a resolution of 72 ppi. The higher the resolution
of the image, the larger the size of the file.

For this image:
JPEG at 300 dpi = 1,526kb
JPEG at 72 ppi = 368kb
