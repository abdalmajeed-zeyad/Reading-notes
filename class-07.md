What's a Table?
A table represents information in a grid format.
Examples of tables include financial reports, TV
schedules, and sports results.

<table>
The <table> element is used
to create a table. The contents
of the table are written out row
by row.
<tr>
You indicate the start of each
row using the opening <tr> tag.
(The tr stands for table row.)
It is followed by one or more
<td> elements (one for each cell
in that row).
At the end of the row you use a
closing </tr> tag.
<td>
Each cell of a table is
represented using a <td>
element. (The td stands for
table data.)
