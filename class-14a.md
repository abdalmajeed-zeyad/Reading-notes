Transforms
2D Transforms
Elements may be distorted, or transformed, on both a two-dimensional plane or a three-dimensional plane.
2D Rotate
The transform property accepts a handful of different values. The rotate value provides the ability to rotate an element from 0 to 360 degrees. Using a positive value will rotate an element clockwise, and using a negative value will rotate the element counterclockwise. The default point of rotation is the center of the element, 50% 50%, both horizontally and vertically. Later we will discuss how you can change this default point of rotation.

2D Scale
Using the scale value within the transform property allows you to change the appeared size of an element. The default scale value is 1, therefore any value between .99 and .01 makes an element appear smaller while any value greater than or equal to 1.01 makes an element appear larger.

Using the scale value within the transform property allows you to change the appeared size of an element. The default scale value is 1, therefore any value between .99 and .01 makes an element appear smaller while any value greater than or equal to 1.01 makes an element appear larger.t is possible to scale only the height or width of an element using the scaleX and scaleY values. The scaleX value will scale the width of an element while the scaleY value will scale the height of an element. To scale both the height and width of an element but at different sizes, the x and y axis values may be set simultaneously. To do so, use the scale transform declaring the x axis value first, followed by a comma, and then the y axis value.
