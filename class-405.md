Terminology:
Linked List - A data structure that contains nodes that links/points to the next node in the list.
Singly - Singly refers to the number of references the node has. A Singly linked list means that there is only one reference, and the reference points to the Next node in a linked list.
Doubly - Doubly refers to there being two (double) references within the node. A Doubly linked list means that there is a reference to both the Next and Previous node.
Node - Nodes are the individual items/links that live in a linked list. Each node contains the data for each link.
Next - Each node contains a property called Next. This property contains the reference to the next node.
Head - The Head is a reference of type Node to the first node in a linked list.
Current - The Current is a reference of type Node to the node that is currently being looked at. When traversing, you create a new Current variable at the Head to guarantee you are starting from the beginning of the linked list.

A circular linked list is a little odd in that it doesn’t end with a node pointing to a null value

Big O:

n O(1) function takes constant time, which is to say that it doesn’t matter how many elements we have, or how huge our input is: it’ll always take the same amount of time and memory to run our algorithm. An O(n) function is linear, which means that as our input grows (from ten numbers, to ten thousand, to ten million), the space and time that we need to run that algorithm grows linearly.
For a little contrast, we can also compare these two functions to something starkly different: an O(n²) function, which clearly takes exponentially more time and memory the more elements that you have. It’s pretty safe to say that we want to avoid O(n²) algorithms, just from looking at that crazy red line!
