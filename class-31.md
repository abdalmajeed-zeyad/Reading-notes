# **Introduction to React and Components**

## Component Based Architecture

**What is a component?**
A component is a modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable set of well-defined functionality that encapsulates its implementation and exporting it as a higher-level interface.

**what are the charactistics of a component?**
Reusability

1. Replaceable

2. Not context specific

3. Extensible

4. Encapsulated

5. Independent

 **What are the advantages of using component based architecture?**

1. Ease of deployment
2. Reduced cost

3. Ease of development
4. Reusable

5. Modification of technical complexity

6. Reliability
7. System maintenance and evolution

8. Independent

## Props  in React

**What is props short for?**
React is a component-based library which divides the UI into little reusable pieces. In some cases, those components need to communicate (send data to each other) and the way to pass data between components is by using props.

**How are props used in React?**

1. define an attribute and its value(data)
2. pass it to child component(s) by using Props
3. render the Props Data

**What is the flow of props?**

uni-directional flow. (one way from parent to child)
