How to create dynamic routes in Next.js
As mentioned in the tutorial on static routing, Next.js defines routes based on the concept of pages.

What does that mean? Every Next.js project comes with a pages folder. The structure of the pages folder determines the structure of your routes and every file inside that folder maps to a route in your application.

Essentially, every time you want to create a route, you need to add a file in the pages folder. Keep in mind that the pages folder itself represents your root url (meaning /).
